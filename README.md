Hardware for the Soviet-era microcomputer I built. See [this repository](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/computer) for more information.

Most of the files in this respository are in KiCad format and require KiCad 4.0.7 to view; however, if you just want to view the schematic, you can find a PDF version in the doc folder or linked in the list below.
